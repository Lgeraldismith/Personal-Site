                        I first took ENC1136 because I needed the words to graduate and it looked like a fun class. I saw mention of Dungeons and Dragons and creating a YouTube short, things that have always intrigued me, and decided to register. Little did I know I would have the opportunity to play the actual game or create the YouTube short about any concept I liked. I think this specific ability, to do the assignments of the course relating to any topic of interest was really what allowed my work to transcend what I'm normally capable of. I was able to pour all my effort into design and content, fueled interest in both the subject and medium in a lot of cases.

                        The first two assignments, the pen pal letter and comic strip, were just beginning. I think I first really grasped what it meant to write about anything of interest when working on the pen pal letter, and this understanding carried through to the comic strip when I could decide how exactly I wanted to work within the medium. I chose to draw my own comic strips on my iPad and while it was more effort I had put into artistic activities since middle school, it was very rewarding. On top of the assignments, this class introduced me into webtoon, one of which I read almost 250 chapters of since that module. These works, my own and what I've read, cemented my understanding of what it meant for a work to be "multi-modal" and the type of nuanced, rhetorical art that comes from it.

                        As I began working on the snack content and videogame menu assignments, I really began to play with digital design. Speaking of the course introducing me to things, I finished the entirety of Expedition: 33 which then inspired my work on the videogame menu. I really enjoyed working in Canva, trying to recreate exactly how this theoretical journal looked in my mind and in the game. I played with font sizes and editing techniques to make the words fit and the images look natural. It really brings a new perspective to playing games, thinking about how much thought and effort goes into a simple pause menu or lore screen. The snack content assignment for me was the opportunity to see this level of effort in another area and hobby of my life, which is educational YouTube videos. As mentioned in my site, I watch creators like Veritasium and Vsauce almost daily whilst the idea of creating YouTube videos goes back all the way back to being 8 years old. Even my friends will say, I love to explain things, especially ubiquitous everyday items with technically fascinating design features. My biggest wish for this assignment is that while I had fantastic inspiration from the aforementioned creators, the magic behind their incredible visuals is still a mystery to me.

                        Finally, the zine and Dungeons and Dragons assignments were the most technically challenging but rewarding assignments. I remember being stuck on the first couple pages of my zine, having grand ideas but no real way to implement them. That's really what these assignments taught me, that the work is just a reflection of my thoughts and my opinions. It doesn't necessarily need to be a magnum opus, just sufficiently express my joy and inform others. This is specifically seen within the page of the zine with the World of Warcraft characters. After passing this photo, the background was just so distracting and there was seemingly too much going on for the page to look at all acceptable. That was until I stopped caring about the aesthetic appeal but rather, what the image being on the page meant. Having experience with WoW, its impact on digital worlds makes it a classic, almost symbolic figure of said worlds. The point of that page was to inform about the benefits of virtual worlds and what better way than the epitome of online community. The Dungeons and Dragons encounter was different than the rest as our words that previously only existed for ourselves and the professor were now to be enjoyed and experienced by our peers. While with the other assignments in the course, I realized how difficult and monumental a task it is to create these works, the DnD encounter taught me the opposite. I've watched Critical Role campaigns before and seen the tremendous effort that goes into them. One of my main hesitations about playing my own game was how difficult and expensive it must be to set up and get a good dungeon master. As mentioned, playing the game and designing my own short encounter showed me how accessible the game was. While designing the encounter was fun, in my experience the real enjoyment came as soon as the party went off track, and the quick-thinking part of my brain was engaged.

                        Finally, the portfolio assignment and the conclusion of ENC1136. I decided to program and host my own website for this assignment as another nod to my main theme, that each assignment was some aspect of my interests. I plan to work in software development and as such, created this site not just for assignments but practice as well. I had fun adding accessibility features and converting my Canva skills acquired from other assignments to aid my future career.
