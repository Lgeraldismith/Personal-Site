                                My name is Lucas Geraldi-Smith and I'm a 4th year biomedical engineering student here at the University of Florida. My family is from Brazil but currently we live in Clearwater, Fl. I've been playing video games since I was around 8 years old, but I also enjoy chess, pickleball, and technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my time here at UF, I've been an active member in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I've met countless friends there, mentored multiple students and planned some really fun events.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After graduation, I currently have two options. I had the opportunity to Intern at Eli Lilly & Co this summer and have the option to return full time. I am also applying to master's programs abroad and hope to study in Stockholm for two years before starting work. My passion is data and the ways it can be used to support healthcare. I have worked a lot with machine learning, developing systems to analyze large healthcare datasets.

                                Outside of work, I really enjoy hanging out with my friends and sharing my hobbies. We all play pickleball together during the breaks and sometimes play super smash bros until the late hours of the night. This desire to share my hobbies is ubiquitous in my life, having even bled into my work in this class.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my four years as an engineering student, I've noticed one thing. In all our coursework, projects, and exams, there is very little room for creative expression. My work in this course represents my creative expression in technical fields, as well as the creative outlets I find outside of the academic world. From the pen pal letter, informing about a niche topic that I enjoy, to the DnD encounter centered in one of my favorite worlds, these pieces function as a wonderland for my creative side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my work, like the pixel art zine, explores topics important to me, like escapism versus reality and the consequences of video game addiction. This course gave me the rhetorical tools necessary to create a work like this that effectively illustrates my experience and actually makes the reader feel the issue. This goes along with the comic strip and my experience with intense courses. My growth from the comic to zine is clear: the techniques learned in class translated into an improvement in the effectiveness and depth of the message. At their core, both works are a reflection of my experience, a simplification made to more effectively inform and convey information, a key aspect of all of my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creating multi-modal media in my time in ENC 1136 was the best part of this semester for me, having access to a creative outlet was fun and exciting, and this joy carries through to the work I was able to do. I took the most interesting parts from video games, like the creature lore that inspired Gustave's journal to how touch screens work in engineering, and developed work that explained both the tangible and intangible aspects of each.
