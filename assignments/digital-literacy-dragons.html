                    <h2 id="project-heading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I crafted a D&D encounter that combines storytelling, game mechanics, and social commentary. This encounter brings together my passion for tabletop role-playing with the course's focus on multimodal communication, demonstrating how games can explore complex themes like labor rights and corporate exploitation while maintaining the whimsical fun that makes board games engaging.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The World: Hasmania's Board Game Multiverse</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hasmania Inc. owns a majority of the world's most popular board games. Promising an innovative "5D experience," they invited the public to participate in an immersive adventure at the Hasmania Inc. Warehouse. But during transport into this new reality, the infrastructure malfunctioned—and now our party is trapped inside the board game worlds themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To escape, we must "win" each board game and collect a passkey from each world. But as we journey deeper, we discover something sinister: Hasmania has forcefully taken over these separate worlds, turning living, breathing places into mere backdrops for their experiment. The party must decide whether to simply collect the codes and escape, or help the suffering people trapped in Hasmania's cruel designs—all in the name of "fun."
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Character: Mudo</h2>
                    <div style="background: var(--color-bg-secondary); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <p>
                            Mudo stands tall at 7'8" but has a slight hunch from picking crops all his life. His skin has a grey tint, with weird tree ring-like patterns that come from a life dedicated to the tree on his farm. His face is old despite his strong body, with wrinkles around his eyes from squinting at things he doesn't understand. Huge hands match his frame, but a fear of breaking things makes them kind and careful hands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After being a farmer for 60 years—seeing everything from his wife's death 10 years ago to his kids moving away—he hasn't had many people to talk to. When he saw a Hasmania ad about feeling young again, he decided to give it a shot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, in this board game world, everything is extremely confusing and overwhelming to Mudo. He's not used to games like Candyland and Monopoly, but he's trying to stay positive. He's excited to use his strength again and have new friends to talk and tell stories to. These conversations have mostly been him trying to understand the "Gen Z" lingo and nodding along like he understands. He helps everyone he meets and gives helpful farming analogies whenever conflict arises.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Mudo's Goals:</strong> Experience adventure again before he's too old. Connect with others and make friends. Help everyone escape. Learn about something other than farming. Find purpose—something to ignite a spark and take him away from his previous lonely life.
                        </p>

                    <h2>The Peppermint Mill Encounter</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Candyland, the party discovers the Peppermint Mill—a site of labor exploitation where Overseer Crumbleton siphons refined sugar (the world's currency and sustenance) to Hasmania Inc. while slashing workers' wages. This encounter challenges players to navigate themes of worker solidarity and corporate greed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
                    <p>
                        The party arrives at Peppermint Mill in Candyland—a brutalist eyesore amid the rolling sugar dunes. This 50-foot-tall warehouse of dirty red brick, topped with black steel and punctured by an ominous brown pipe, refines the sugar that serves as both food and currency for Candyland's inhabitants. But trouble brews: workers have discovered their refined sugar is being siphoned away by Hasmania Inc., while their wages have been slashed due to "budget concerns."
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Players must either negotiate with the corrupt Overseer Crumbleton or join forces with the rebellion to take him down and claim the gumdrop key he wears around his neck. The encounter offers multiple paths to success:
                    </p>

                    <div style="background: var(--color-bg-secondary); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Path 1: Diplomacy</h4>
                        <p>
                            Players investigate the mill, discovering that 60% of sugar flows through a portal marked with the Hasmania logo (Investigation DC 12). They find correspondence between Crumbleton and King Candy discussing reduced worker pay. Confronting Crumbleton in his office leads to tense negotiations—or combat if pushed too far.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Path 2: Join the Rebellion</h4>
                        <p>
                            The rebels grant each party member magical candy items as they storm the mill:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sour Patch Spell Bag:</strong> Adds 1d4 acid damage to spells once per short rest</li>
                            <li><strong>Licorice Rope:</strong> 50ft edible rope granting advantage on animal handling</li>
                            <li><strong>Sour Strips Robe:</strong> Rainbow robe granting advantage on deception and creating false footprints</li>
                            <li><strong>Candy Cane Staff:</strong> Controls sugar flow (works 3 times before breaking)</li>
                            <li><strong>Jolly Rancher Daggers:</strong> Five throwable daggers dealing 1d6 piercing damage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Warehouse Interior</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inside, the industrial space features greasy conveyor belts, a sugar-dust fog, and an aqueduct of processed sugar flowing toward the export pipe. Players can gain tactical advantage by climbing to walkways (Athletics DC 8) or using sugar piles for cover. The stark contrast between the workers' poverty and Crumbleton's extravagant office underscores the encounter's themes of inequality.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Overseer Crumbleton</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/crumbleton.png" alt="Character art of Overseer Crumbleton, a gingerbread construct villain" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;">
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../assets/images/crumbleton.png" target="_blank">View full size image</a></p>

                    <h3>Resolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether through combat or negotiation, defeating Crumbleton causes his gingerbread form to crumble into warehouse smog, leaving behind only the mysterious gumdrop key. While its purpose remains unclear, the party moves forward with spirits lifted from helping the working people of Candyland.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>
                        This encounter demonstrates how D&D can explore real-world issues through fantasy metaphor. The labor strike narrative resonates with contemporary discussions about worker rights, while the candy-themed setting and magical items maintain the whimsical tone appropriate for the board game world the players inhabit. By offering multiple solution paths, the encounter respects player agency and different play styles.
                    </p>
